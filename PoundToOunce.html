      <p>What is a Pound?</p>
      <p>One pound is defined as a unit of mass/weight equal to 16 ounces, or 0.45359237 kilograms. One pound is equal
        to 7,000 grains in the avoirdupois or apothecaries' systems.</p>

      <p>The pound is a US customary and imperial unit of weight. A pound is sometimes also referred to as a common
        ounce. Pounds can be abbreviated as lb, and are also sometimes abbreviated as lbs, lbm, or #. For example, 1
        pound can be written as 1 lb, 1 lbs, 1 lbm, or 1 #.</p><br />

      <p>What is an Ounce?</p>
      <p>One ounce is a unit of mass/weight equal to 1/16 of a pound. The common ounce should not be confused with the
        troy ounce, which is equal to 1/12 of a troy pound.[2]</p>
